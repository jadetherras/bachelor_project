# A STUDY OF TDA METHODS FOR SCRNA VELOCITY

<b> try of UMAP parameter
  
This jupyter notebook contains some tests of parameters for parametric UMAP (data embedding method) implementation and can be used to generate plot from these tests. 
  
  
<b> try of ScVelo parameter
  
This jupyter notebook contains some tests of parameters for ScVelo (velocity embedding method) implementation and can be used to generate plot from these tests. 
  
  
<b> parametrisation
  
This jupyter notebook contains the main part of this project.
It's contains : 
synthetic dataset generation and biological data
test for UMAP and parametric UMAP
new methods for velocity embedding (implementation and test) 
methods for velocity and dataset inverse embedding
verification for test of the jacobian and scvelo using PCA
